## 4. [Future]

I am looking for a job in the field of generative AI. Ideally, I want to work in a lab that is doing cutting-edge research, as I plan to do a PhD in the next 5 years. With my current knowledge and experience, I believe that I am qualified for a research assistant position and a junior MLops engineer position. If you are interested in my profile, please contact me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/taylor-tang/) or [email](mailto: tay.tang@outlook.com).

## 3. [Post-university]

Prior to graduation, I have been planning for my career path. I have a strong interest in generative AI. As the first batch of beneficiary and witness of the rising of ChatGPT, I am very excited about the future of generative AI. I believe that what we have seen so far is just the tip of the iceberg. The stuff that I learned so far, although it was been taught in one of the best universities in the world, is still far from the cutting edge of the industry. Therefore, I decided to continue my study in the field of generative AI.

### 3.1 [DeepLearning.AI]

Andrew Ng is one of the most influential figures in the field of AI. His teaching has inspired me to learn more about AI. Therefore, I decided to take his courses on Coursera. I finished the following courses:

- [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/)
- [Generative AI with LLMs](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-with-llms/)
- [Finetuning Large Language Models](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/finetuning-large-language-models/)

### 3.2 [Andrej_Karpathy]

Andrej Karpathy is also one of the most influential figures in the field of AI. In terms of education, he is not as famous as Andrew Ng, but his explanation of the concept of AI is very clear and easy to understand. The way he constructs the course is also very interesting, such as code every line of the neural network from scratch.
From a master graduate's perspective, I first thought that the content was too simple. But as I went through the course, I found that I was wrong. I have been using the framework and libraries out of the box, without knowing what is actually going under the hood. This course is a great opportunity for me to re-learn the details that I missed out.
I finished the following videos:

- [The spelled-out intro to language modeling: building makemore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaCmpygFfXo&t=223s)
- [Building makemore Part 2: MLP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCH_1BHY58I&t=525s)
- [Building makemore Part 3: Activations & Gradients, BatchNorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6sfmUTpUmc)
- [Building makemore Part 4: Becoming a Backprop Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8SA3rM6ckI&t=3701s)
- [Building makemore Part 5: Building a WaveNet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3YJ5hKiMQ0)
- [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY&t=31s)

### 3.3 [Extended_Research]

The research project I did in the university was about comparing the traditional CNN-based model and the transformer-based model in the task of bushfire satellite image segmentation. The result was quite interesting, as the transformer-based model outperformed the CNN-based model.
However, I have been using the default, or slightly modified, models from frameworks and libraries. I proposed that a future research direction is to build a multi-spectral SegFormer model that is specifically designed for bushfire satellite image segmentation.
Hence, right after I finished my master degree, I started to work on this project. I finished the following:

- [Multi-spectral SegFormer]()
  Traditional CV models are designed for RGB images. However, satellite images are usually multi-spectral images. This modified SegFormer model can take multi-spectral images as input, and output the segmentation mask with a higher accuracy.

I am working on the following:

- [Live satellite image segmentation]()
  This project is to put the multi-spectral SegFormer model into production. The model will be deployed on the cloud, and it will be able to segment the satellite images in real-time.

### 3.4 [Side_Projects]

I often have some ideas that I believe them are quite interesting. I am working on the following solely for fun:

- [A neural network board game design]()
- [A LLMs-based Avalon agent]()
- [A AI music tuning algorithm]()
- [A indie game of pets and family]()
- [A advertising slogan generation tool using GenAI]()
- [A LLMs-based fact check and spam filtering tool]()



## 2. [University]

On December 2021, I received an offer from the University of Melbourne to study Master of IT. On February 2022, I started the first semester of my master degree. During I completed coursework, internship and a research study. On December 2023, I finished my master degree with an average score of 83.3.

## 1. [Pre-university]

On August 2021, I started to learn programming. I have no prior knowledge of programming.
It was both exciting and frustrating at the first, but I am glad that I have made it through.

### 1.1 [Python]

Python was the first programming language I learned. I heard that it is easy to learn, so I decided to start with it.
I finished the following courses:

- [Fundamentals of Computing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals)
  By Rice University, this is a quite comprehensive course that covers the basics of Python and some data structures.
  Most importantly, I think the teaching content is quite interesting, as it teaches mostly by building games.
  The IDE used in this course is [CodeSkulptor](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/), which is a browser-based Python interpreter.
  It is simple and easy to use, most importantly, I don't need to configure the environment.

Some key concepts I learned from this course:

- [i] Data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`
- [ii] Control flow: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`
- [iii] Object-oriented programming: `class`, `method`, `inheritance`
- [iv] I/O: `print`, `input`, `open`, `read`, `write`
- [v] GUI: `simplegui`
- [vi] Algorithm: `monte carlo`, `breadth-first search`, `depth-first search`

### 1.2 [Java]

At the time I finished the Python course, I didn't know what to do next. I knew that Java is a popular programming language, so I decided to learn it.
I finished the following courses:

- [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming)
  By Duke University, this is a quite comprehensive course. It teaches the basics of Java, and it teaches how to use Java to build a multi-component software.
  From here, I learned some basic of not just programming, but also software design. Meaning, to use a few code lines that each does one thing, to build a complex software.
  This experience is quite different from the Python course, which teaches mostly by building one thing at a time.
  The IDE used in this course is BlueJ, which is a Java IDE that is designed for beginners.

Some key concepts I learned from this course:

- [i] Java basics: `class`, `method`, `object`, `inheritance`, `interface`, `package`, `import`, `access modifier`, `static`, `final`, `abstract`, `enum`
- [ii] Data structures: `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `LinkedList`, `Queue`, `Stack`
- [iii] Algorithm: `sorting`, `searching`
