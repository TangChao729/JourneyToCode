# JourneyToCode
A brief history of my coding journey

This repo is to record my programming learning journey.

## 1. [Pre-university]
On August 2021, I started to learn programming. I have no prior knowledge of programming. 
It was both exciting and frustrating at the first, but I am glad that I have made it through.

### 1.1 [Python]
Python was the first programming language I learned. I heard that it is easy to learn, so I decided to start with it.
I finished the following courses:
- [Fundamentals of Computing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals)
By Rice University, this is a quite comprehensive course that covers the basics of Python and some data structures.
Most importantly, I think the teaching content is quite interesting, as it teaches mostly by building games.
The IDE used in this course is [CodeSkulptor](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/), which is a browser-based Python interpreter.
It is simple and easy to use, most importantly, I don't need to configure the environment.

Some key concepts I learned from this course:
- [i] Data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`
- [ii] Control flow: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`
- [iii] Object-oriented programming: `class`, `method`, `inheritance`
- [iv] I/O: `print`, `input`, `open`, `read`, `write`
- [v] GUI: `simplegui`
- [vi] Algorithm: `monte carlo`, `breadth-first search`, `depth-first search`

### 1.2 [Java]
At the time I finished the Python course, I didn't know what to do next. I knew that Java is a popular programming language, so I decided to learn it.
I finished the following courses:
- [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming)
By Duke University, this is a quite comprehensive course. It teaches the basics of Java, and it teaches how to use Java to build a multi-component software.
From here, I learned some basic of not just programming, but also software design. Meaning, to use a few code lines that each does one thing, to build a complex software.
This experience is quite different from the Python course, which teaches mostly by building one thing at a time.
The IDE used in this course is BlueJ, which is a Java IDE that is designed for beginners. 

Some key concepts I learned from this course:
- [i] Java basics: `class`, `method`, `object`, `inheritance`, `interface`, `package`, `import`, `access modifier`, `static`, `final`, `abstract`, `enum`
- [ii] Data structures: `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `LinkedList`, `Queue`, `Stack`
- [iii] Algorithm: `sorting`, `searching`
