# 1. [Overview]

Quote from the [subject handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp90042):
"Much of the world's knowledge is stored in the form of text, and accordingly, understanding and harnessing knowledge from text are key challenges. In this subject, students will learn computational methods for working with text, in the form of natural language understanding, and language generation. Students will develop an understanding of the main algorithms used in natural language processing, for use in a diverse range of applications including machine translation, text mining, sentiment analysis, and question answering. The programming language used is Python."

# 2. [Reflections]

Probably the most difficult subject I have ever taken. This is advanced machine learning course, in which the content include the history of NLP, the basic knowledge of NLP, and the state-of-the-art NLP models. I got hands-on experience with NLP models like word2vec, BERT, and GPT-2. The course is very well structured, and I would like to address that the lecturer is the best lecturer I have ever met. His teaching is impeccable.

ChatGPT was just released when I was doing this course, and I hoped to understand how it works. But the course content seems to be a bit outdated, I hope the course is updated now.

# 3. [Assessment]

- [Assignment 1&2]()

  > - 2 short programming assignments.
  > - Assignment 1: [Assignment 1](./A1/as1_TaylorTang_1323782.ipynb)
  > - Marks received: 8/8
  > - Assignment 2: [Assignment 2](./A2/as2_TaylorTang_1323782.ipynb)
  > - Marks received: 9/9
  > - Proposed solution: [Assignment 1 Solution](./A1/StartAirModel%20Crow's%20foot%20v2.pdf)
  > - Original file: [Assignment 1 mwb file](./A1/StarAir_ER_Diagram%20Final.mwb)
  > - Feedback: [Assignment 1 Feedback](./A1/A1_feedback.md)
  > - Marks received: 146.8/200

- [Assignment 3]()

  > - A group-based (group of 2-3) research project essay working from Week 6 to 12 with a Week 12 submission.
  > - Quite intensive workload, especially considering the project was changed to private for some reason. I managed to use A100 gpu to train the model, and seems feels not enough. The accuracy I got is just over 23%. Average accuracy is 20%.
  > - Specification sheet: [Assignment 3 Specification](./A3/project.pdf)
  > - Report: [Assignment 3 Report](./A3/nlp_report_1323782_1.pdf)
  > - Feedback: [Assignment 3 Feedback](./A3/Feedback_237470_1323782_Tang_Taylor.pdf)
  > - Marks received: 23.5/30

- [Assignment 4]()

  > - 1 peer review assignment of other student groups' research project essays.
  > - Marks received: 4.5/5

- [Final Exam]()

  > - Closed book exam (40%).

- [Final Mark]()
  > - Final mark received: 82/100
