# 1. [Overview]

Quote from the [subject handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp90024/):
"The growing popularity of the Internet along with the availability of powerful computers and high-speed networks as low-cost commodity components are changing the way we do parallel and distributed computing (PDC). Cluster and Cloud Computing are two approaches for PDC. Clusters employ cost-effective commodity components for building powerful computers within local-area networks. Recently, “cloud computing” has emerged as the new paradigm for delivery of computing as services in a pay-as-you-go-model via the Internet. These approaches are used to tackle may research problems with particular focus on "big data" challenges that arise across a variety of domains."

# 2. [Reflections]

This course is famous of its diversity of content. The lectures slides and tutorials are fine, but the assignments are very challenging. The first assignment is a group assignment, which warms you up with the distributed system. The second assignment is where things get interesting. We need to build a full web application with cloud computing. Meaning the team should cover everything of a web-application such as front & back-end, database, deployment, etc. On top of that, it challenges us to use automated deployment tools like Ansible and Docker. Not only that, we need to come up with an interesting topic and show the solution. It is a very challenging assignment, especially when you have 5 people in the team. 

I lead the team and I am very proud of the result. Although I believe we could have done better, I did not put too much pressure on my team. I am glad I took this course, as it is very practical.
