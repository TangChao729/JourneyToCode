# 1. [Overview]

Quote from the [subject handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/comp90050):
"Many applications require access to very large amounts of data. These applications often require reliability (data must not be lost even in the presence of hardware failures), and the ability to retrieve and process the data very efficiently.

The subject will cover the technologies used in advanced database systems. Topics covered will include: transactions, including concurrency, reliability (the ACID properties) and performance; and indexing of both structured and unstructured data. The subject will also cover additional topics such as: uncertain data; Xquery; the Semantic Web and the Resource Description Framework; dataspaces and data provenance; datacentres; and data archiving."

# 2. [Reflections]

More like a research course. Lectures and tutorials are not very useful. The only assignment is to conducting a research on a topic of our choice. I guess I was benefited from this course, as this is the first time I write a research paper.
