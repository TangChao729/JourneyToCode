# 1. [Overview]

Quote from the [subject handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp90054):
"The key focus of this subject is the foundations of autonomous agents that reason about action, applying techniques such as automated planning, reinforcement learning, game theory, and their real-world applications. Autonomous agents are active entities that perceive their environment, reason, plan and execute appropriate actions to achieve their goals, in service of their users (the real world, human beings, or other agents). The subject focuses on the foundations that enable agents to reason autonomously about goals & rewards, perception, actions, strategy, and the knowledge of other agents during collaborative task execution, and the ethical impacts of agents with this ability"

# 2. [Reflections]

One of the best course delivered by the University of Melbourne. The content of the course is both interesting and advanced. The course is very well structured, and the lecturer is very experienced. The course is very challenging, but I have learned a lot from it.

- [Assignment 3]()

  > - One team-based project, involving 2 to 3 team members, requiring approximately 30 - 40 hours of work per student.
  > - This is a project to design and implement a AI-agent to play the game Othello. At the end of the project, each team combat with each other in the format of a tournament, and gain ELO points. The team with the highest ELO points wins the tournament. Each team is required to submit not a report, but to maintain the code base on GitHub, and the lecturer will mark the code base. Quite a unique project.
