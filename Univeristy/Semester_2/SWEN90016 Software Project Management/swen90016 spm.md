# 1. [Overview]

Quote from the [subject handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2019/subjects/swen90016):
"The aim of this subject is to introduce students to the software engineering principles, processes, tools and techniques for analysing and managing complex software projects."

# 2. [Reflections]

If there is one course I can avoid to take, this is the one. Content is very basic, and the lecturer is very boring. What's more is that the lecturer is very strict on the marking, and the marking criteria is very vague. Communication with the tutor is like talking to a wall. I would not recommend this course to anyone.

> There is one slide in the tutorial that I found very offensive:
> "What are the benefits to ‘Developing Countries’ from organizations that outsource to them?

> a) Increased wages
> b) Job prestige and education
> c) Increased quality of life
> d) All of the above (correct answer)
>
> Statistically speaking, there is no evidence that outsourcing has increased the wages of developing countries. The reason some company would like to "outsource" jobs to other parties focus on either "increase quality" or "lower cost". The b) option of job prestige and education is very offensive, I have no idea why the lecturer would put that in the slide. The c) option of increased quality of life is also very offensive, as it implies that the developing countries are not living a good life, and the developed countries are helping them to improve their quality of life.

> I raised my concern to the tutor immediately, and he said he will pass it on to the lecturer. However, the slide was not changed for the rest of the semester. I am very disappointed by the lecturer's attitude towards this issue.
> I then raised my concern to the lecture directly, no response was received.
> I then raised my concern to the subject coordinator after the semester, the subject coordinator said he will address the issue.
>
> I checked the slide again in 2023, the slide is gone.
