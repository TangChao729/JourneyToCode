# 1. [Overview]

Quote from the [subject handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2022/subjects/comp90015):
"The subject aims to provide an understanding of the principles on which the Web, Email, DNS and other interesting distributed systems are based. Questions concerning distributed architecture, concepts and design; and how these meet the demands of contemporary distributed applications will be addressed."

# 2. [Reflections]

Advanced Java programming course. Differ to the semester 1 Java course, this course is more about distributed system, so some knowledge of VMs is much needed. Okay course, I had fun when doing the assignment.

# 3. [Assessment]

- [Assignments]()

  > - Project work of approximately 50-55 hours of work, which reinforce lecture content and develop programming and writing skills. Project work is assessed in stages throughout the semester, with half of the work typically due in Week 8 and the remaining work due in Week 12.
  > - Assignment 1: [Assignment 1](./A1/P2P_downloader/COMP90015%20Distributed%20System%20Assignment%201(1).pdf)
  > - This project is to build a P2P client downloader. Very entertaining project especially when you see your program become faster and faster. We even build some advanced features like multi-threading and UI. I am very proud of this project.
