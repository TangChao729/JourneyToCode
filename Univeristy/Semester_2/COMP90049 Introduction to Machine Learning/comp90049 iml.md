# 1. [Overview]

Quote from the [subject handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2024/subjects/info90002):
"Machine Learning is the study of making accurate, computationally efficient, interpretable and robust inferences from data, often drawing on principles from statistics. This subject aims to introduce students to the intellectual foundations of machine learning, including the mathematical principles of learning from data, algorithms and data structures for machine learning, and practical skills of data analysis."

# 2. [Reflections]

Despite its name "Introduction to Machine Learning", this course is actually quite difficult, especially for students who have no prior knowledge of statistics and probability. The course is very well structured, and the lecturer is very experienced. It is indeed an introduction to machine learning, hence the content involved is not quite useful in industry. However, I have benefited a lot from this course, as it has laid a solid foundation for my future study in machine learning.
