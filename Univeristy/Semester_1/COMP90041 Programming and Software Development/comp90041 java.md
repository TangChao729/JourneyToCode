# 1. [Overview]

Quote from the [subject handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp90041):
"The aims for this subject is for students to develop an understanding of approaches to solving moderately complex problems with computers, and to be able to demonstrate proficiency in designing and writing programs. The programming language used is Java."

# 2. [Reflections]

This is probably the most interesting course I have taken in my master degree. The content of the course is very basic, teaching the fundamental of Java programming. However, the assignments are very interesting, making a rogue-like game. During I had a lot fun, and even created some Maps for the game, and shared with my classmates.
