# 1. [Overview]

Quote from the [subject handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2023/subjects/comp90038):
"The aim of this subject is for students to develop familiarity and competence in assessing and designing computer programs for computational efficiency. Although computers manipulate data very quickly, to solve large-scale problems, we must design strategies so that the calculations combine effectively. Over the latter half of the 20th century, an elegant theory of computational efficiency developed. This subject introduces students to the fundamentals of this theory and to many of the classical algorithms and data structures that solve key computational questions. These questions include distance computations in networks, searching items in large collections, and sorting them in order."

# 2. [Reflections]

Well taught course, the lecturer is very experienced and knowledgeable. The content is quite theoretical, but the lecturer is able to explain it in a way that makes it interesting. I had a lot of fun in this course.
