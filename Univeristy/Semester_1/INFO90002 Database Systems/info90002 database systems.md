# 1. [Overview]
Quote from the [subject handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2024/subjects/info90002):
"The subject introduces key topics in modern information organisation, particularly with regard to structured databases. The well-founded relational theory behind modern structured query language (SQL) engines, has given them as much a place behind the web site of an organisation and on the desktop, as they traditionally enjoyed on corporate mainframes. Topics covered may include: the managerial view of data, information and knowledge; conceptual, logical and physical data modelling; normalisation and de-normalisation; the SQL language; data integrity; transaction processing, data warehousing, web services and organisational memory technologies. This is a core foundation subject for both the Master of Information Systems and Master of Information Technology."

# 2. [Reflections]
This is one of the foundation course of my master degree. Comparing to other courses, this course is theoretical and not fun. A lot textbook spoon feeding content. Relatively easy in terms of workload and assessment. However, some terms, especially the naming conventions of relational database are quite confusing.
