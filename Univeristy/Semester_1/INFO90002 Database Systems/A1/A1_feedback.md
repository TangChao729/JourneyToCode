Avoid having spaces in your attribute names in the conceptual model, I am glad to see you fixed this in the physical model though. You created booking class to be a weak entity, but you did not create any identifying relationships for it (double-border diamonds), so which entity is its parent? Also, there were some composite attributes that you created that should have been separate entities, such as employment type and supplier. Unfortunately, I could not annotate your submitted file directly, as there was an error, but there were also a couple key constraints and participation constraints that were incorrect or inconsistent, for example, you said crew-flight_instance is a 1-M relationship in the conceptual model, but in the physical model you made it a M-M relationship (which would be correct). In the physical model, you should not be creating an attribute for every day (monday_schedule_depart, monday_estimate_arrive, tuesday_...), or for every booking class (class_d, class_c,...) You could just create 1 attribute and use an ENUM data type. For example, in flights table, you could have DepartDay ENUM(Mon, Tue, Wed,...) and ArriveDay ENUM(Mon, Tue, Wed,...) if you wanted to do it like this
