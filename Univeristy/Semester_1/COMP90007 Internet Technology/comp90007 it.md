# 1. [Overview]

Quote from the [subject handbook](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/subjects/comp90007):
"The subject will introduce the basics of computer networks to students through a study of layered models of computer networks and applications. The first half of the subject deals with data communication protocols in the lower layers of OSI and TCP/IP reference models. The students will be exposed to the working of various fundamental networking technologies such as wireless, LAN, RFID and sensor networks. The second half of the subject deals with the upper layers of the TCP/IP reference model through a study of several Internet applications."

# 2. [Reflections]

One of the capstone course, relative easy content. Mostly teaching old fashion networking technologies, in its original form. The delivery of the course is quite boring.
