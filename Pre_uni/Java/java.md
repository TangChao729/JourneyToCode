# Overview

At the time I finished the Python course, I didn't know what to do next. I knew that Java is a popular programming language, so I decided to learn it.
I finished the following courses:

- [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming)
  By Duke University, this is a quite comprehensive course. It teaches the basics of Java, and it teaches how to use Java to build a multi-component software.
  From here, I learned some basic of not just programming, but also software design. Meaning, to use a few code lines that each does one thing, to build a complex software.
  This experience is quite different from the Python course, which teaches mostly by building one thing at a time.
  The IDE used in this course is BlueJ, which is a Java IDE that is designed for beginners.

## My Experience

The previous course of Python is limited to the scope of works that can be done in a browser-based IDE. This course, however, is much more comprehensive, and it teaches how to build a multi-component software, which is more powerful.

Some of my works:

1. [Baby Names]()
2. [Vigen√®re Cipher]()
3. [Earthquake Data]()
4. [N-Grams]()
5. [Recommendation System]()
