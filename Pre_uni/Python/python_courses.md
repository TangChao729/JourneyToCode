# Overview

Python was the first programming language I learned. I heard that it is easy to learn, so I decided to start with it.
I finished the following courses:

- [Fundamentals of Computing Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/computer-fundamentals)
  By Rice University, this is a quite comprehensive course that covers the basics of Python and some data structures.
  Most importantly, I think the teaching content is quite interesting, as it teaches mostly by building games.
  The IDE used in this course is [CodeSkulptor](https://py3.codeskulptor.org/), which is a browser-based Python interpreter.
  It is simple and easy to use, most importantly, I don't need to configure the environment.


## My Experience

I started as a complete rookie, I have no prior knowledge of programming. Some key concepts I learned from this course:

- [i] Data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`
- [ii] Control flow: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`
- [iii] Object-oriented programming: `class`, `method`, `inheritance`
- [iv] I/O: `print`, `input`, `open`, `read`, `write`
- [v] GUI: `simplegui`
- [vi] Algorithm: `monte carlo`, `breadth-first search`, `depth-first search`

I gradually learned these concepts during the course, by building small & simple arcade games. This is a good way to learn programming, as it is fun and interesting. Some of my works:

[Pong](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_Z6508XeNh3_7.py)
[Tic-Tac-Toe](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_5RAA0Y0MyZ_0.py)
[Zombie Apocalypse](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user49_JQDWazRuMn_5.py)
[Black Jack](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_wqJP5ajdKI_0.py)
[Astroid](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_1gTQhw0dxg_0.py)
[RickRocks](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_HfxRK9jhdv_4.py)
[2048](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_FRKCWpRX2y_30.py)
[Cookies Clicker](https://py2.codeskulptor.org/#user48_6m7GObe9CM_5.py)

I will recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn programming, especially for those who have no prior knowledge of programming. It is a good start.
