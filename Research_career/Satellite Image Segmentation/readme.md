# 1. [Overview]

During my last semester at the University of Melbourne, I was working on a research project under the supervision of Dr. [Richard Sinnott](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1503-richard-sinnott). The project is about using satellite images and segmentation models to detect bushfire burnt areas.

At first, I was quite excited with the project. I had many thoughts about how to implement the knowledge I learned from the university into the project. For example, I was thinking about using RNN and Model-of-life to predict the burnt area, using terrain and weather conditions for higher accuracy etc. However, I soon realised that the SoW might be too big to undertake. I had to narrow down the scope of the project. I decided to focus on the segmentation model.

I started to read papers about segmentation models. Following by collecting the dataset and labelling the images. It was quite a time-consuming process. I evaluated several segmentation models, including U-Net, Mask R-CNN, SegFormer, etc. 

My research is well received by the supervisor, and examiners. The final mark of the project is 85/100.

I admit that my research is not very innovative and limited in scope. However, I have learned a lot from this project. I have learned how to conduct a research project, how to write a research paper, how to present a research project, etc. I believe these skills will be very useful in my future research career.
