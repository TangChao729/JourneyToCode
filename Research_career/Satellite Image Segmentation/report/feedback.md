Hi Taylor,

Organisation of Thesis and Clarity of Expression
9
The organisation thesis was excellent. The expression was clear and logical, and most jargon was accurately described. The description of underlying concepts and context of the problem was particularly good.
9
This paper is overall well-written and organized. The paper reads nicely and each section flows well from the previous and to the next. One minor thing to fix is to change the usage of the word "like" to "such as". "Like" sounds a tad too informal for academic writing. 
Grasp of the problem and review of the relevant literature
18
The literature review was done very well, offering a solid overview of the related works. The referencing was also done carefully, including relevant sources throughout. A solid grasp of the problem was demonstrated.
16
This paper overall shows good grasp of the problem and review of the relvant literatures. The description of the problem is solid, complete with the background of the problem that presents the severity of bushfires, which strengthens the motivation for this research. Drawbacks of traditional methods are also identified and discussed, which naturally lead to the explanation as to why deep learning models--partiuclarly CNNs and Transformers--are suitable to address the weaknesses of these traditional methods. One gap I identified is that there is no in-depth explanation of how CNNs and Transformers work. Considering that these two classes of models are the centerpoint of this work, more in-depth explanation and comparison between these two classes of models should be performed. 
Research method (including data collection and analysis where relevant)
17
A range of datasources and models were presented and very well described. Multiple models were compared and a comprehensive comparison was made. Good use of existing technologies.
15
The data collection and preprocessing are meticulous and is presented with great detail. The chosen dataset and benchmarks also provide a strong bedrock for the experiments. Table 3 is also useful, as model complexity is an often overlooked part of deepl earning research. However, there are some parts that could be improved, such as: elaborating on the meaning of the bands mentioned in figure 5, more in-depth explanation of some models (e.g., the YOLOv8 model), and providing more insights on the format of the input and output to the models. 
Presentation of results
13
The results were expressed in a clear and articulate manner, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the subject. The use of diagrams further enhanced the presentation, providing a good visual interpretation of the concepts discussed.
15
The experiment results are discussed in a very detailed fashion. This section clearly outlines the strengths and weaknesses of each model and also clearly identifies the limitations of the research 
Conclusion and suggestions for future work
12
The conclusion and suggestions summarised the finding succinctly. The potential shortcomings were effectively communicated, demonstrating a clear understanding of their implications in the context of the study.
13
Solid conclusion and future work section. This paper has identified sensible and promising future directions, and these have been discussed in sufficient detail. 
Contribution
16
The report offered a novel contribution is very good considering there was some limitations on the available data. Current approaches have been evaluated in a way relevant to the contemporary literature.
18
This paper provides a much-needed comparison of two main classes of modern, deep-learning-based, computer-vision models in the task of bushfire detection. The diverse set of state-of-the-art models mean that this experiment is on-track with recent developments. The weakness of this research is the lack of dataset size and diversity, but this is acceptable considering the timeframe of the research, and this issue has been identified in the paper. This work can certainly be extended in the future by adding more datasets into the mix. 
Comments

Overall an excellent report. A fascinating read.

This is overall an excellent paper that provides a clear and comprehensive elucidation of bushfire detection research; from the background, literature review, experimental setup, and the discussion of the experiments themselves. It is certainly up to the standard of an academic conference/journal paper.
